## Introduction 
This document is a Readme for the **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project** as part of the John Hopkiins University Data Specialisation course

## Purpose 
The README outlines the purpose of the project and the software components, files, datasets and documents that make up this project solution

This document is an extention of the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset** original README referenced below as it builds on the data produced as part of that study.
The original datasets used as a starting point are used under licence referenced in [1] below.

In order to fully appreciate what how the run_analysis.R solution works the README, codebook(features_info.txt) and files for the original project should be reviewed.

## Project Definition - Excerpt
The following paragraph is an excerpt from the assignment webpage outlining the project
definition to which a solution is required.

"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

## Components 
The solution to the project definition is made up of the following components stored in github
[https://github.com/DB-2/DB-2-Repo/tree/master/TidyAssignment]

1. this **Readme.rmd** which explains the solution to the project definition and how the components
   are linked together.
2. **run_analysis.R** 
   an R script to read in the original datasets (see read file code excerpt)
   and using various R functions and packages re-assemble the original datasets into a single 
   Tidy data frame ( as per definition below) before mean values are calculated for all
   variables grouped by subject and activity. A csv file of this data is the created using
   fwrite (see fwrite file code except).
3. **getting_cleaning_data_project_codebook.rmd** 
   A rmd document containing the definition of all column values produced in the grouped.txt
   file by the run_analysis.R script mentioned above, their meaning and origin. Additional 
   information can be found in the origial projects codebook features_info.txt 
4. **grouped.txt** 
   A space delimited txt file mentioned above containing the average(mean) of all measurements    relating to the training and test measurement data referenced in the features_info.txt 
   below and in the codebook grouped by each test subject that took part in the original study
   and the activities they performed as part of that study    
5. **Input files used from original study** 
+ X_test.txt

+ y_test.txt

+ subject_test.txt

+ X_train.txt

+ y_train.txt

+ subject_train.txt

+ activity_labels.txt

+ features.txt
   
Descriptions below
   
## Pseudo Code/Script summary 

the run_analysis.R script performs the following:

+ read the **X-test** measuremment data, **y-test** activity and the **subject test** files

+ repeat the same for the equivalent **train** files

+ read the **activity labels** description file and the measurement **features** file

+ create a vector of column indexes from the features file based on mean and std description of   the variables

+ use this to subset the train and test data tables

+ use it also to replace the column names with more descriptive names in train and test files also prefixing them with the string "mean-" to show their ultimate state as averaged variables in the final tidy data set csv files produced.

+ cbind the subject and y activity data tables for both test and train data

+ cbind above to the equivalent test and train data tables

+ finally rbind both combined test and train data tables and merge with the activity description by activity code

+ group the data table by subject and activity and get the mean of all variables (hence "mean-" prefix step above)

+ write the above as a csv called **grouped.csv**


## File reads summary 

This section outlines the code commands used to read in the files

```
############ TEST FILES SECTION ############

## Read the X_test file
## Print the number of rows of each DF as you go to ensure correct row alignment
## Read the y_test activity file
## Read the test subjects file

X_test<-read.table(file="X_test.txt", sep = "",header = F,colClasses = c("numeric"), na.strings ="NA",stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("X_test rows:",dim(X_test)[1]))

y_test<-read.table(file="y_test.txt", sep = "",header = F, col.names=c("activityCode"),na.strings ="NA", stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("y_test rows:",dim(y_test)[1]))


subj_test<-read.table(file="subject_test.txt", sep = "",header = F, col.names=c("subject"), na.strings ="NA", stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("subj_test rows:",dim(subj_test)[1]))

############## TRAIN FILES SECTION ############

## Read the X_train file
## Print the number of rows of each DF as you go to ensure correct alignment
## Read the y_train activity file
## Read the train subjects file

X_train<-read.table(file="X_train.txt", sep = "",header = F,colClasses = c("numeric"), na.strings ="NA",stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("X_train rows:",dim(X_train)[1]))

y_train<-read.table(file="y_train.txt", sep = "",header = F, col.names=c("activityCode"),na.strings ="NA", stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("y_train rows:",dim(y_train)[1]))

subj_train<-read.table(file="subject_train.txt", sep = "",header = F, col.names=c("subject"), na.strings ="NA",stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("subj_train rows:",dim(subj_train)[1]))

############ ACTIVITY AND FEATURES SECTION ##################

## Read the activity_labels file to get the acivity description for later merging
## Read the features file which ultimately reflects the list of X_test and X_train column names
## as these files are from the same source split in two
## Extract only those feature names that have the string mean or std in it
## the features obs number can be used to construct a vector of column indexes
## to subset the X_test & X_train data frame for the desired columns required (Assignment task 2)
## the features column name can also be used to change the default var column names
## to the more descriptive feature column names (Assignment task 4)
## Also, prefix each of the column names at this point with the prefix "mean-" to inidcate that final variables both those mean and std 
## will be an average of the mean and std variables by subject and activity. This is the easiest point to do this operation
## although the data has not technically been averaged as yet

activity_desc<-read.table(file="activity_labels.txt", sep = "",header = F,col.names=c("activityCode","activity"), na.strings ="NA", stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("activity_desc rows:",dim(activity_desc)[1]))

features<-read.table(file="features.txt", sep = "",header = F,col.names=c("colIndex","colName"), na.strings ="NA", stringsAsFactors= F)
print(paste("features rows:",dim(features)[1]))

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
